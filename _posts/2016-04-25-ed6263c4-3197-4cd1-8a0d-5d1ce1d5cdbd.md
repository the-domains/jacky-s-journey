So it begins

After months of waiting I finally got the email I have waited for. Activation of my beta site of the Grid. Yes the site that you are on it still in beta. 

This site Jacky's journey will be dedicated to the journey I make as a person. It will have snippets of my thoughts, things I do and experience. If this is not you cup of tea then move on there is nothing to see here ;-) 

For those that do stick around thank you for showing your interest in my (and our) life.
