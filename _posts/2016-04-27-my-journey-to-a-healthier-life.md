My journey to a healthier life

Having a healthy life seems to be more and more extinct as we speak. Where food and fusion of many different culture results into more wonderful dishes.

I love food I think I might love food too much. When I am sad I like to eat snacks and juke food. Worst part is that I don't exercise regularly at al. I have periods that I train for couple weeks everyday. And then periods that I train for months and months.

The issue is that I never change my diet or food intake. This is going to stop and change, for the last two months I have been very conscious in what I eat and most importantly how much I eat. Just by eating only what I need a day I have already started losing weight. Combined togeher with running 5-8km everyday. I have felt so much more energetic everyday.

The food that I eat now is less carbs more fruit and vegetable. And pretty much lost all crips ( my biggest sin when a bag opens I have to finish it). It's still going to take a while before I am considered healthy. But then i did neglected my health for a long time! I know it is still a long road and struggles that I have to go through but we will get there !
